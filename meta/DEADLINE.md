## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

    My app, titled SettleScore!, takes in a valid city and state in the united states and calculates a score which reflects
    various demographic characteristics of the city which was queried. The app makes use of JSON Restful API's from various
    sources including, but not limited to, the US census. The census returns demographic data about the state as well as crime
    data. I use another API to count places of interest and recreational sites within a city as well. Another API gets a map
    of the city and displays it to the user as well. The score which the app calculates combines both API's in a meaningful and
    useful way. The app is an external API tool meant to help people living in the us pick a city to live in.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

    I learned a lot more about API's and how to use them. During the previous project, I had little understanding of what JSON was. Now, because
    I had to figure out how to use my own apis by myself I was forced to do more research into api's and other web services. In project four the
    API was handed to us whereas for this project we had to make it work in an open ended way. I have a new appreciation for apis and I think
    it will be fun in the future to write other more useful api programs/apps.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

    I would have started significantly earlier. With finals week approaching I thought I would be okay putting off the project but
    my procrastination caused me a lot of unecessary headache working on the project. I also would have spent more time looking for
    APIs instead of just jumping straight into the project with a rough idea and working from that. I planned how the app would look
    and work without actually realizing I didnt have access to apis which could make the app work. I was too ambitious too late.

    THIS IS A NOTE TO THE GRADER OF THIS PROJECT, IF AN IOEXCEPTION IS ENCOUNTERED MY MAP'S API KEY EXPIRED, (Dr. Cotterell said it was okay to put this information here). You will need to update the API KEY to see the map. This is the API I used, and this is my school email I can reset it from anywhere: tjn92948@uga.edu
